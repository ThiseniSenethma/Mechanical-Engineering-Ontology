# Mechanical Engineering Ontology

## Scope
This mechanical engineering ontology consist of below six main aspects.
1. Engineering Design
2. Knowledge Discovery
3. Quality Control
4. Education and Training
5. Educational Resources
6. Engineering Solutions
<br>
<ui>
<li> Engineering Designs are used by engineers as a plan to create functional products. The ontology includes a few methods and parameters used in creating engineering designs. </li>
<li> Knowledge Discovery is acquisition of data and using them to model, create and evaluate products. The ontology includes a few methods and tools used in knowledge acquisitions.  </li>
<li> Quality Control is an important aspect of mechanical engineering where products are tested and evaluated to check if they meet the standard. The ontology includes a few management systems used to check the quality of deliverables.</li>
<li> Education and Training is a vast growing aspect in mechanical engineering. Each day new engineers are created. The ontology includes a few areas in the curriculum and how they connect with other aspects and their subclasses.</li>
<li> Educational Resources are created day by day in mechanical engineering field. The ontology includes the main contributor of the resources and how they connect and contribute to other aspects.</li>
<li> Engineering Solutions are in vast numbers. The ontology includes a few instances of engineering solutions and what other instances contribute in creating these solutions.</li>
</ui>
